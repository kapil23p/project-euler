## Project Euler — Python Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to problems from Project Euler, implemented entirely in **Python**. Project Euler focuses on mathematically intensive problems that require strong logical reasoning and efficient algorithms.

### What’s Inside
- Python implementations of solved Project Euler problems
- Clean, readable, and optimized code
- Regular updates as I solve more problems

### Purpose
- Improve problem-solving and algorithmic thinking
- Strengthen foundations in mathematics and programming
- Maintain a public record of consistent learning
